This branch contains the sourcecode of Skin Deep as released by Blendo Games.

It's based on dhewm3 1.4.1

I only added this README, everything in neo/ like the source archives they gave me.

See neo/readme_build.txt for Blendos Games instructions to build this code.

This only works on Windows.

See the main branch for a version adjusted to build and work on additional operating systems.
