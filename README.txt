NOTE: This README (everything behind the line of dashes) was included in the SkinDeep sourcecode
(skindeep_sourcecode_2025_02_13.zip)

SkinDeep isn't really based on dhewm3 1.5.4, but some older version.

Building SkinDeep on Linux should work as expected with CMake.

The only thing you need to change to run the Demo is to go to the skindeep_demo/ directory from Steam,
there into basedemo/glsl/ and 
rename "motionBlurBlendo.frag" to "motionblurBlendo.frag" (note the lowercase "b" in "blur")
and "motionBlurBlendo.vert" to "motionblurBlendo.vert"

This is necessary because unlike on Windows, filesystems on Linux are case-sensitive,
and materials/fx.mtr in pak000.pk4 has the line "program            motionblurBlendo.vfp" where
it's written like that.

dhewm 3 version 1.5.4 for Windows

Released August 3rd 2024 - celebrating 20 years of Doom3!

This build contains the new ImGui based settings menu and Soft Particles.
You can open the menu with F10, unless you have something else bound to F10,
or by entering "dhewm3Settings" in the console.

dhewm3_notools.exe is built without the MFC-based tools like the D3Radiant level editor.
It should work better with nvidia DSR and AMD VSR (which render the game at a higher resolution than
the display supports and then scale it down, like some kind of anti-aliasing on steroids).

This is built with Visual Studio 2017, so if it doesnâ€™t start on your system make sure you have
the Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable for X86 installed.
You can download it at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist

 ABOUT
=======

dhewm 3 is a Doom 3 GPL source port, known to work on at least Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD.

The goal of dhewm 3 is bring _DOOM 3_ with the help of SDL to all suitable
platforms.

Bugs present in the original _DOOM 3_ will be fixed (when identified) without
altering the original gameplay.

The official homepage is: https://dhewm3.org

Mods supported by dhewm3: https://dhewm3.org/mods.html

The project is hosted at: https://github.com/dhewm

Compared to the original DOOM 3, some of the changes of dhewm 3 worth mentioning are:

- 64-bit port
- SDL for low-level OS support, OpenGL and input handling
- OpenAL for audio output, all OS-specific audio backends are gone
- OpenAL EFX for EAX reverb effects (read: EAX-like sound effects on all platforms/hardware)
- Gamepad support
- Better support for widescreen (and arbitrary display resolutions)
- A portable build system based on CMake
- (Cross-)compilation with MinGW-w64
- An advanced, mod-independent settings menu (opened with F10 by default)
- Lots of bugfixes

See Changelog.txt for a more complete changelog.


 HOW TO INSTALL
================

You'll need the game data from a Doom3 installation patched to 1.3.1.
Specifically, you'll need the following .pk4 files for the main game:

  Filename          Size   MD5-sum
----------------- ------  ---------------------------------
 base/pak000.pk4   337MB   71b8d37b2444d3d86a36fd61783844fe

 base/pak001.pk4   220MB   4bc4f3ba04ec2b4f4837be40e840a3c1

 base/pak002.pk4   398MB   fa84069e9642ad9aa4b49624150cc345

 base/pak003.pk4   303MB   f22d8464997924e4913e467e7d62d5fe

 base/pak004.pk4   227MB   38561a3c73f93f2e6fd31abf1d4e9102

 base/pak005.pk4   540KB   2afd4ece27d36393b7538d55a345b90d

 base/pak006.pk4   214KB   a6e7003fa9dcc75073dc02b56399b370

 base/pak007.pk4   118KB   6319f086f930ec1618ab09b4c20c268c

 base/pak008.pk4    12KB   28750b7841de9453eb335bad6841a2a5
-----------------------------------------------------------

... and (optionally) these .pk4 files for the *Resurrection of Evil* addon:

  Filename           Size  MD5-sum
----------------- ------- ---------------------------------
 d3xp/pak000.pk4   514MB   a883fef0fd10aadeb73d34c462ff865d

 d3xp/pak001.pk4    98KB   06fc9be965e345587064056bf22236d2
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. or alternatively you can use the demo00.pk4 from the free Demo version, see below for more information.

Just put the .pk4 files into the corresponding directories (base/ and d3xp/) that are next to this README.

Alternatively you can have the dhewm3 binaries (dhewm3.exe, base.dll etc) and the game data in
separate places and tell dhewm3 where to find the directory that contains base/ and d3xp/,
with the following commandline argument:
> dhewm3.exe +set fs_basepath c:\path\to\Doom3\

The following sections explain how to obtain these .pk4 files.

 ... from CD/DVD + Patch
 -----------------------
If you bought the game on CDs/DVD, base/pak000.pk4 - pak004.pk4 and d3xp/pak000.pk4
can be copied from the disks, the other files are from the patch.

On Windows you can just install the game and the official 1.3.1 patch for Windows
(get it at https://archive.org/details/Doom_3_1.3.1) and then get the files from the
installation directory (or copy dhewm3 in there).

 ... from Steam
 --------------
First you need to buy Doom3 of course (https://store.steampowered.com/app/208200/DOOM_3/).
It also includes the Resurrection of Evil Addon (and the BFG Edition re-release of the game,
which is not supported by dhewm3).

Thankfully the game from Steam is already fully patched to 1.3.1.

On Windows, just install it and copy the game data from there (see above for what files are needed).

 ... using the Doom3 Demo gamedata
 ---------------------------------
First you need to download the Doom3 Demo, of course.
For Windows, you can get D3Demo.exe at Fileplanet and just run the installer:
https://www.fileplanet.com/archive/p-15998/DOOM-3-Demo

You'll need `demo/demo00.pk4` for playing, either in exactly that directory, or you can copy it
into `base/`. Note that you don't need the patches of the full version, adding their pk4s when
using Demo gamedata breaks the game.

`demo00.pk4` has a size of 462MB but there are minimal differences between the one
for Linux and Windows, so they have different md5sums:
Windows : md5sum bd410abbb649b9512d65b794869df9fe size 483534533 Bytes
Linux   : md5sum 70c2c63ef1190158f1ebd6c255b22d8e size 483535485 Bytes

Both work on all platforms though, but the Linux demo had been released two months after
the Demo for Windows and contains at least one tiny bugfix: A missing string for " or "
which is used when binding multiple keys to the same action - the Windows Demo shows
a nonsense string instead.

(You can download the Linux demo at 
 https://files.holarse-linuxgaming.de/native/Spiele/Doom%203/Demo/doom3-linux-1.1.1286-demo.x86.run
 and, in a POSIX compatible shell with `tar` installed, extract the relevant file from the .run
 installer with `sh doom3-linux-1.1.1286-demo.x86.run --tar xf demo/`)


 Configuration
===============

See Configuration.txt for dhewm3-specific configuration, especially for 
using gamepads.

 GENERAL NOTES
===============

# Back End Rendering of Stencil Shadows

The Doom 3 GPL source code release **did** not include functionality enabling rendering
of stencil shadows via the "depth fail" method, a functionality commonly known as
"Carmack's Reverse".  
It has been restored in dhewm3 1.5.1 after Creative Labs' patent finally expired
(https://patents.google.com/patent/US6384822B1/en).

Note that this did not change the visual appearance of the game, and didn't seem to
make a noticeable performance difference (on halfway-recent hardware) either.
